## Tried and True

### [Olive Garden Chicken Pasta](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/slow-cooker-olive-garden-chicken-pasta/)

* This is an absolute madlad
* Makes about 1.5 weeks of food at 1 meal a day
* Italian and good, but on the rich side for sure

### [Beef Stroganoff](https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/slow-cooker-beef-stroganoff/1b3f2c90-0924-4744-a7c2-1b82a4d4e133)

* Def super legit
* If you like mushrooms, put more into this than you are expecting (they shrink)
* On the rich side, but not as much as the Olive Garden

### [Texas Pulled Pork](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/92462/slow-cooker-texas-pulled-pork/)

* Very tasty
* On the wet side, but goes great on sandwiches if youll eat it quick
* Great on quesaldillas as well

### Beef Barbacoa Tacos

* This guy is a go-to, perfect for having chicks over. My mommy sent it to me so I don't have a link
* Most links you'll find are super complicated. Don't make it complicated.
* Ingredients:
    * Any taco meat (I like sirloin strips or flank steak)
    * Apple cider vinegar
    * Barbacoa slow cooker spice packet [like this one](https://www.amazon.com/Old-El-Paso-Seasoning-Barbacoa/dp/B07QBDM3QD/ref=asc_df_B07QBDM3QD/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=475825687178&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13645712116782791919&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9012578&hvtargid=pla-1019259515271&psc=1)
    * Taco extras (tortillas, cheese, lettuce, taco sauce you like)
* Cut the meat in strips, put the spice packet and some vinegar (eyeball it) on low for like 8 hours and make tacos with it. boom. slaps

### Chicken Tacos and variants ([like this](https://www.spendwithpennies.com/crockpot-chicken-tacos/))

* just like one above. many variants out there.
* MOST SIMPLE WAY: chicken and a jar of green salsa. can add a cut up onion for extra dankery
* buss it into some tortillas with cheez and a boneless Pacifico and you rollin
* can throw in a jar of pico or tomatoes or chiles


## A Lot of Work

### [Pork Ramen](https://www.chowhound.com/recipes/slow-cooker-pork-ramen-31178)

* This was tasty, but required a lot of up front prep
* I also wasnt sure if you could premake all the ramen at once so it ended up not being super plug and play for eating after it was made
